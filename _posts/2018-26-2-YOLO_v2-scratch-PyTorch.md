title: Implementing YOLO v2 from scratch using PyTorch
---

In these series of posts, I will be trying to implement the YOLO v2 object detection algorithm from scratch using PyTorch. 

I intend to reference heavily the following implementations of YOLO v2. 

1. https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet (Implementation by the author of YOLO)
2. https://github.com/marvis/pytorch-yolo2

These tutorials are in no way to intended to match the accuracy of original implementation, though that would be a desirable
bonus. But as of now, the only thing I'm bothered is get a working implementation that can produce comparable results. 

The main purpose of this exercise is to sharpen my PyTorch skills. This series primarily acts a log where I can write about 
what I learned, and to share it with others.
